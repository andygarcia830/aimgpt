Your business is only as good as your \nemployees. Every employee represents a facet of your organization to clients \nand the business community, from the front line to operations and up to the \nexecutive offices. Hence, hiring the wrong person ca n cost you more than just \nmoney.  \nBut the quest for the best talent has always been challenging for most \norganizations. You do not just fill job vacancies; you need to obtain the finest \nones that would fit the organization. The business reality is that man aging and \nengaging people in your company take time. But dealing with the poor \nperformance of a wrong hire can take up to 70 percent more time than a good \nhire among your workforces . \nWhen you hire the right people, you can focus on running your business, rather \nthan worrying about whether employees are getting the job done, and done \nright, the first time.  \nA wrong hire can also have a lasting impact on profitability, productivity, and \norganizational morale. Aside from compensation and benefit costs and \ntraining hours invested, it can also affect other factors such as team \nengagement, organizati on culture, and work disruption.  \nThis program will develop the skills of hiring managers and recruiters to \nbecome better interviewers through a structured and systematic interview \nprocess.  They will learn to develop a clear selection criterion, conduct a \nstandard system focusing on the individual's competencies, and have an \nassessment based on proven behavioral science studies.  \n \nLearning how to ask the right interview questions and evaluating the \napplicant's skills through specific key behavior indicators eliminates bias and \nhelps maximize the chances of getting the right talent selection.   \nThis proven behavioral interviewing method shall impact overall recruitment \ncost and talent efficiency and improve the culture in the organization.  \nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES  \nThis course provides HR recruiters and hiring managers with the skills and tools:  \n1. Address the common mistakes mo st hiring managers commit, such as \nconducting an unstructured interview or the contrast error pitfall.  \n2. Build well -trained interviewers who know how to build rapport and create a \ncomfortable atmosphere.  \n3. Define behavioral competencies that drive performance and use questions \nabout core, leadership, functional and technical competencies  \n4.

Instead of focusing on technologies, it \nhighlights the analytical methods and techniques to make sense of common business \nquestions and challenges --- from know ing what happened with the business \n(Descriptive Analytics), what could happen (Predictive Analytics), and what one should \ndo (Prescriptive Analytics). Participants will go through a process that will reframe \ntheir business concerns as a data question, app ly analytical tools and communicate the \ninsights for management decision making. The program hones their understanding of \nkey analytics concepts by using real business cases and applying it to their own context. \nWith case discussions, simulation games and team report, the class works together to \nbuild a data -driven managerial culture that can create competitive advantages from \nbusiness analytics.  \nWHAT YOU WILL LEA RN \n \nData & Analytics Framework  \n\u2022 Apply the analytics framework to your own context  \n\u2022 Learn how to visualize data  \nDescriptive Analytics  \n\u2022 Define and calculate descriptive statistics  \n\u2022 Manage quality with statistical process controls  \nPredictive Analytics  \n\u2022 Find relationship among variables  \n\u2022 Predict future probabilities and trends  \nInsights & Prescription  \n\u2022 Model business objectives and constraints  \n\u2022 Interpret optimization results, usage & limitations  \nDecision -Making  \n\u2022 Synthesize their data to insight journey  \n\u2022 Communicate insights extracted from data  \nKEY BENEFITS  \n\u2022 Introduce the Data -Analysis -Insights -Decision framework  \n\u2022 Create charts, graphs  and network diagrams to visualize data  \n\u2022 Compute measures of central tendencies & variability  \n\u2022 Calculate sample sizes  \n\u2022 Create and analyze process control charts  \n\u2022 Perform single and multiple regression analysis using Excel  \n\u2022 Estimate the predictive power of the variables  \n\u2022 Transform business objectives and constraints into mathematical model  \n\u2022 Set-up and perform linear optimization using Excel  \n\u2022 Compare & contrast model results  \n\u2022 Apply the analytics framework to a business problem needing decision  \n\u2022 Report the insigh ts and gather feedback  ", "doc_id": "423beef7-8f75-45e7-82da-e83539a3d4ea", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a86093bd296533c7b9402f7c2a99dbee6cd943cd1011d3e0a02ab0b5dea5f8f1", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "OEP-Business-Analytics-July-2023.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3328, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "2c5a2bc5-4206-48df-bf50-5c5ce4390a3d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc34c5e9-c118-4061-a967-4ef4972d2ff0": {"__data__": {"text": "  \n \n FOR INQUIRIES:  \nSchool of Executive Education and Lifelong Learning, Asian Institute of Management  \nEugenio Lopez Foundation Building, Joseph R.

OVERVIEW  \nThe School of Executive Education and Lifelong Learning in partnership with the \nPhilippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF) offers this program  designed to \nhelp participants establish organizational practices that support effective \ndevelopment, imple mentation and appraisal processes of their respective business \nand service continuity plans. While this program is informed by the continuity \nframeworks advanced by international standards, the course provides a process \nframework that is adaptable to SMEs,   public sector organizations, and private sector \norganizations currently that are in the early development stages of  their continuity \nmanagement strategy.  \nResilience has become a strategic goal for organizations in this current era \ncharacterized by persi stent turbulence emanating from natural and human -induced \nhazards. It is underpinned by the ability of the organization to sustain practices that \nsupport preparedness and foresight on risks, as well as the agility and flexibility to \ndirect organizational a ction towards a strategic vision in turbulent contexts.  \nGiven the pandemic, many organizations beyond large private sector actors are \nbuilding their continuity management strategies. Public sector organizations, small \nand medium enterprises, as well as no n-profit organizations recognize the \nimportance of continuity management. These organizations are at various stages of \nthe continuity plans, with non -profit organizations undertaking the development of \nPublic Service Continuity Plans (hence business and service continuity \nmanagement).  \nOne of the ways that organizations can perpetuate resilient practices is through \neffective business and service continuity management, which is a system of \nprocesses that enable organizations to operate continuously amid disru ptions.  A \nprocess approach to business and service continuity management signifies that \norganizations go through a three -phase journey, which include the: (a) development, \n(b) implementation, and (c) appraisal phase of the business/service continuity plan \n(BSCP). To achieve effective business and service continuity management, \norganizations have to devote equal time and attention to each phase.   \nWhile organizations go through rigorous process of developing their BSCP, there are \ninstances when attention fall s short in the implementation and appraisal stages. The \nimplementation of BSCP during a crisis or a disaster is met with challenges, often \nbecause of the context mismatch between the plan and the actual scenario, the lack \nof management support, and also th e", "doc_id": "ce173a7d-3f23-48e7-b4f8-81a1eebe4cad", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cc32eda488eecc9637cbcf80715cdd7ad2796329622f92e96a200593b1c94826", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "OEP-Business-Continuity-Management-April-2023.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3733, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "6ce508f9-40b0-437e-b147-8d79358e1528", "3": "35e9fecc-a98b-4963-b504-b9b4792eb60d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "35e9fecc-a98b-4963-b504-b9b4792eb60d": {"__data__": {"text": "the plan and the actual scenario, the lack \nof management support, and also th e lack of training programs that sometimes \ncause organizational members to freeze, become disconcerted, and  overlook their \nBSCP.

The program \nis anchored on the principles of Nation Branding, a business strategy used by \ncountries, synthesizing key forces (political -economic, cultural -artistic & \nhistorical -social) f or optimal positioning in a global -tech marketplace.  \nLOCAL AND GLOBAL MARKET:  How can timeless Filipino values inspire others \nthrough   \nthe stories  we tell of our products & services? Our brilliant nurses have already paved \nthe way for the foundations of a  Philippine nation brand. Filipino prominence and \nexcellence  \nin the Care Industry: health, education , and domestic services have been celebrated \nworldwide .  \n \nHow can Filipinos take advantage of this Brand Equity?  \nHow do  we inventively use associations of the Filipino culture of care, first -rate \nservice ,and resourceful  resilience to our local hospitals, higher educational \ninstitutions,  \nand Philippine corporations to get  global attention? How can a Philippine brand  \nexperience  be rendered in 'everyday ' products and services at home and abroad?  \n \nPURPOSE CORPORATIONS:  The program will train students to inventively \nempower stakeholders and engage consumers - guiding ways of selling and \nbuying - through a Filipino Value System (Jocano, 1994). Renowned Filipino Values \n-aruga, masipag, maka -tao, matiyaga, \nlifes tyle and stimulates company culture. How can Filipino -ness drive Branding \nCommunication and Management?     \nPROUDLY ASIAN:  Filipino businesses and institutions ambition to flourish in a  \nglobal marketplace  where they can be comfortable in their own skin, proud of  \ntheir racial identity, and articulate in  expressing their singular character. Moreover,  \na lively appreciation & promotion of native land &  people heighten confidence in  \n one's Asian ancestry, where by a Nation's Brand can be founded on.  \n \nDESIGN -BUSINESS -TECH:  As things digitally transform in a VUCA (volatile, \nuncertain, complex, and ambiguous) global marketplace, the course, in 5 parts, \nteaches a basic process of 'styling' next -generation Filipino pr oducts & services. \nThis creative process is significantly conceptual & firmly rooted in - Philippine \nStudies and its branches: Anthropology, Philosophy, Culture, Language, and Art \nStudies - to radically animate the branding blueprint (promise, position, voi ce, \nvalues, visual identity, architecture, and journalism).  \n ", "doc_id": "ac2d2b00-757f-43d0-a02f-f54f70b5aebc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4e81717ccbe55b0b9cc6a4dedf092ae86427a7002528c66ee71b4e6b40d035ca", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "OEP-Corporate-Branding-Online-Program-November-2022-Updated.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3396, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "9c937ee8-c11c-40b4-b141-21184baf61bd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a22c53d1-fc9d-4e1d-ba71-9cfd6aa5c801": {"__data__": {"text": "  \n \n FOR INQUIRIES:  \nSchool of Executive Education and Lifelong Learning, Asian Institute of Management  \nEugenio Lopez Foundation Building, Joseph R.

Administrative nightmares are some of \nthe things that keep many executives awake at night. These iss ues include not \nhaving a strong business process flow that can be communicated and aligned \nacross the company and having a workforce that is disconnected from the \ncompany due to that lack of alignment, making them indifferent about the \ncompany's priorities  or, worse, highly demotivated.  \nWith the increasing demands of day -to-day involvement, the engagement of the \nexecutives with the rest of the team is crucial to producing the expected business \noutcome for the organization. Hence, their productivity and effe ctiveness are \nhinged highly on how their work meetings, strategic priorities, and functional \ndeliverables are structured efficiently.  \nThis organizational challenge is where the Executive Assistant (EA) or Department \nSecretary can add value to the Executiv es they are supporting. The role involves \nperforming not only primary office duties such as managing schedules and \ncalendars, coordinating travel plans and itineraries, and attending meetings and \ntaking minutes, but also project management of critical prio rities for the \nexecutives, excellence in execution, overseeing the office or department budgets, \nmanaging correspondences and writing reports, and developing programs to \nimprove the productivity of the office and interactions between departments and \ndemons trating leadership in areas where they can add value to the company.   \nA topnotch EA works with the organization's leaders to proactively look for ways \nto improve the organization's processes, systems, procedures, and colleague \ninteractions.

As leaders, you \nare no longer just responsible for accomplishing the tasks but are responsible for the \npeople who are doing the tasks. And this shift often brings  a mix  of emotions: \nExcitement, Fear, Anticipation, and Insecurity if  new supervisors and managers  do not \nhave a good onboard ing and fundamental training for smooth transitioning to these \nleadershi p roles.  \n \nHigh -performing team members are often promoted to leadership roles based on \ntheir track record and individual output. Many organizations often assume that their \nsuccess as individual contributors will ensure their success as a leader. However, \npeople management competencies, coaching and engagement skills, and flexible and \nadaptable leadership styles required to lead and inspire the team don't always come \nnaturally. Hence, new leaders must learn, develop, practice, and adopt essential \nleadership qualities and skills over time.  \n \nDeveloping a good leadership onboarding allows a good shift of individual contributors \nto transition into leadership roles effectively, which will be good  eventually  for the \npeople they lead, and the business or function th ey manage. New supervisors and \nleaders need to  develop confidence in their leadership qualities, strengths, and \nabilities to be effective in their people management roles. In particular, the first 90 \ndays are crucial for new leaders to earn tr ust and buy -in from the team and inspire \nthem to pursue organizational goals and drive operational excellence.  \n \nThe program's primary focus is to help new and aspiring supervisors and managers \nunderstand the unique opportunities and challenges of being a leader and ho w to cope \nwith this new context and environment. The program content and topics, individual \ncoaching, and the preparion of a leadership transition plan will allow new leaders to \nbe on the right track and increase the likelihood of success in their first 90  days in the \nrole. They will also be provided with frameworks, strategies, and tools they can use to \novercome common leadership challenges.    \nLive Online  \n \nMay 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 2023  \n8:30 AM to 12:00 PM   \n \nFace to Face On -Campus   \n \nMay 26, 2023  \n8:30 AM  to 5:00 PM   \n \n(GMT+08 ) on all dates  \n \nPROGRAM FEE  \nPHP 75,990.00 or USD 1,382.00* \n \n*The prevailing  exchange rate at the date of \npayment may apply  \n \nYOUR PROGRAM FACULTY  \n \n \n \nAlbert G.

Successful \ndistribution involves many moving parts and methods requiring a strong \ndistribution management strategy fueled by real -time information.  \n \nEssentially, the partner distributors are considered part of a company's sales \nteam and are in charge of driving dire ct and indirect distribution of the products. \nEffective and efficient distribution of products translates to more visibility, \nawareness, penetration, and trial of the products and ultimately impacts market \nshares and competitiveness.  \n \nIn this course, parti cipants will learn how to develop successful company \ndistributor management strategies. The program will take the participants on a \njourney -  from introducing them to successful sales processes to equip them to \ndesign their sales strategies for the genera l trade, manage a portfolio of brands \nfor selling, and finally think about how to embed the sales operating discipline at \nall levels of the organization. Participants will be exposed to several resource \nindustry experts who can share real -life best practic es in critical areas of \ncommercial operations.  \n \nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES  \nAt the end of the course, participants will be able to:  \n\u2022 Develop go to market modesl for various channels and prodcuts  \n\u2022 Understand sales operations management strategy  \n\u2022 Develop and execute a j oint business programs with  distributors  \n\u2022 Learn the distributor management models  \n\u2022 Define Channel Marketing and its key elements  \n\u2022 Create sales operations strategies of distributors via capacity review  \n\u2022 Manage the mutl -functional Teams and Stakeholders in Sales management  \nWHAT YOU WILL LEARN  \n\u2022 Distributor Account Management  \n\u2022 Budget Management  \n\u2022 Sales & Operations Planning  \n\u2022 Demand Management Planning  \n\u2022 Business Planning and Capacity Review  \n\u2022 Trade Coverage  Planning  \n\u2022 Brand Activation in Channels", "doc_id": "ed029629-e5c6-433a-81c0-2e181841a462", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8b08efef5ab885886a78d53d19bf33bc6d46909c3acaebb3f31e51f16ba212f2", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "SEELL-OEP-Distributor-Management-Program-August-2023.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3448, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "6db063f5-9b26-4035-9d8d-152c59346b15", "3": "57b531b1-af04-488d-a622-5dff1e6e6679"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "57b531b1-af04-488d-a622-5dff1e6e6679": {"__data__": {"text": "Review  \n\u2022 Trade Coverage  Planning  \n\u2022 Brand Activation in Channels  \n\u2022 Strategic Trade  Promotions Planning  \n\u2022 Business Analysis and Review  \n ", "doc_id": "57b531b1-af04-488d-a622-5dff1e6e6679", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c60b8fb615e573929dda50906f37073e62198beff88ffd23ae7220f39a5ab8ae", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "SEELL-OEP-Distributor-Management-Program-August-2023.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3380, "end": 3526, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "6db063f5-9b26-4035-9d8d-152c59346b15", "2": "ed029629-e5c6-433a-81c0-2e181841a462"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "097233c3-545b-4c9e-86f0-a58d21cd5cd5": {"__data__": {"text": "  \n \n FOR INQUIRIES:  \nSchool of Executive Education and Lifelong Learning, Asian Institute of Management  \nEugenio Lopez Foundation Building, Joseph R.

While the \nbreakdown may differ from company to company, this Pareto principle generally holds \ntrue. Some customer accounts are sim ply more valuable than others.  And losing one \nof those critical accounts could have dire consequences for your business's bottom \nline and long -term viability.  \n \nBecause these customers represent such a significant portion of your business, it \nmakes sense t hat you should invest in their long -term satisfaction and success with \nyour company.  \n \nThe ultimate purpose of Key Account Management is to develop long -term, mutually \nbeneficial business relationships with specific top customers to meet strategic goals \nand optimize value in both companies.  \n \nThe Key Account Manager is considered part of a company's sales team, but they are \nnot your standard salespeople. Account management is not about volume sales or \nfast-talking sales tactics but about earning trust and bui lding authentic connections. \nIt is about relationship management, communication, problem -solving, partnership, \nand collaboration.   This is particularly true In the enterprise market, where 80% of \nrevenues come from 20% of the company's customers. The acco unt managers \nmanaging these important accounts must possess good communication and strategic \ndecision -making skills and strong leadership qualities to build partnerships.  \n \nIn this course, participants will learn how to develop successful key account \nmanage ment strategies for their company. The program will take the participants on \na journey -  from introducing them to successful sales processes to equip them to \ndesign their sales strategies for key accounts, manage a portfolio of brands for selling, \nand fin ally think about how to embed the sales operating discipline at all levels of the \norganization. Participants will be exposed to several resource industry experts who \ncan share real -life best practices in critical areas of commercial operations.  \n \nPROGRAM OB JECTIVES  \n \nAt the end of the course, participants will be able to:  \n1. Develop key account management program for key accounts  \n2. Understand sales operations management strategy  \n3.

The organization depends on its leadership on how to react and to \nwhich direction it needs to go. During an economic crisis, cost reduction activities \nbecome a knee -jerk reaction. Cash becomes the king again. Tightening of the \nbudget by reducing operational expenses, canceling external e ngagements, \nstopping training, and reorganizing the structure to minimize labor costs are \neveryday actions to free -up cash. These are done in good intention, but when it is \npoorly planned and executed, it may result in benefits but short -lived and may do \nmore harm than good because of lack of customer focus and decreased service \nlevels.  \n \nLean Six Sigma (LSS) is a strategy that supports the short -term need of the \norganization to survive safely and to rapidly reduce cost and looking at long -term \nroad to trans form into an agile organization for high performance and sustainable \ngrowth. Lean Six Sigma is a marriage of two compelling leading -edge \nmethodologies. Lean has been in existence since the post -war era focuses on \nwaste reduction, and Six Sigma started sinc e the late '80s, which focuses on output \nvariation reduction.  These two separate methodologies were combined as we \nenter the 21st century. Many companies subscribed to the LEAN principles and \nmethods.  More than 80% of the top 500 Fortune companies in the  US are into Lean \nSix Sigma to drive cost reduction, productivity improvement, and revenue growth \nthrough effective quality management.   \n \nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES  \n \n Understand how Lean Six Sigma (LSS) can improve business results in \norganizations  \n  How to focus on and prioritize initiatives using LSS  \n  Understand and apply the LSS way on Cost Reduction  \n  Develop deployment plans of LSS for sustainable growth  \n \nWHAT YOU WILL LEARN  \n  Assessment of the impact of the external environment to cost structure, \nrevenue, and profitability  \n   Understanding the current business model  \n   Project selection and definition in the context of cost reduction  \n ", "doc_id": "281b4477-a8b3-4c0b-a42b-0bc4494d1a06", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e227f26779387ca5e29110b5a02ad7b39027f7a98bd16a2899ee810422516c64", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "SEELL-OEP-Lean-Six-Sigma-for-Business-Leaders-June-2023.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3447, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "68ab01df-71ee-4151-9b7d-3aa68621a594", "3": "2e241e53-2726-4f9b-a3d8-b69584b13803"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e241e53-2726-4f9b-a3d8-b69584b13803": {"__data__": {"text": "business model  \n   Project selection and definition in the context of cost reduction  \n   Supplier Input Process Output Customer (SIPOC) Analysis  \n   Understanding the Voice of the Customer and Critical to Quality  \n   Value Stream Mapping Analysis  \n   Process WASTE elimination  \n   Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ)  \n   Process VARIATION and 5M possible causes  \n   The DMAIC Concept (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)  \n    Different roles in Lea n Six Sigma deployment  \n ", "doc_id": "2e241e53-2726-4f9b-a3d8-b69584b13803", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b019906b1b6ac1df8343bd5653caee6f8f8001bbaa6e8f3ce34f3432a721718e", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "SEELL-OEP-Lean-Six-Sigma-for-Business-Leaders-June-2023.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3358, "end": 3842, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "68ab01df-71ee-4151-9b7d-3aa68621a594", "2": "281b4477-a8b3-4c0b-a42b-0bc4494d1a06"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6365241a-415a-43e1-b36a-50dba0936c20": {"__data__": {"text": "  \n \n FOR INQUIRIES:  \nSchool of Executive Education and Lifelong Learning, Asian Institute of Management  \nEugenio Lopez Foundation Building, Joseph R.
